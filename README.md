To refresh and my skills on OOP principles i took grokking oop course and challenges.
at the end :

1. **Understanding Objects and Classes:**
   - Mastered the creation of objects and classes, encapsulating data and behavior effectively.

2. **Encapsulation :**
   - Learnt encapsulation, organizing code and exposing only necessary interfaces for interaction.

3. **Inheritance:**
   - Learnt inheritance for code reuse, inheriting properties and methods from parent classes.

4. **Polymorphism:**
   - Practiced writing flexible code in treating different objects uniformly.

5. **Abstraction:**
   - Adopted abstraction principles, focusing on essential features and simplifying complexity.
